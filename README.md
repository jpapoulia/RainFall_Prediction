# RainFall_Prediction
This project was conducted as part of the "Machine Learning" course in the MSc program Data Science & Machine Learning at NTUA.

The main objective was to analyze a provided dataset in order to solve a binary classification problem: predicting whether it will rain the following day. The process involved performing thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset’s structure and key patterns, followed by suitable preprocessing steps. Subsequently, various classification models were trained and evaluated, primarily using the F1-Score as the performance metric. All steps and implementation details are included in the code.ipynb file within this repository.

As part of this assignment, an internal Kaggle competition was organized (citation: Paraskevi Tzouveli. (2023). ML-ECE-NTUA 2023-24: 1st lab project. Kaggle. – Link to Competition). The competition involved 252 participants, including undergraduate students from the ECE School, master's students from the Data Science & Machine Learning MSc program, as well as PhD candidates enrolled in the course. I ranked 7th out of 252 participants.
